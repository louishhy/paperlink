Paperlink DB is a web application that helps you to organize your papers, connecting them and create a network of papers. 

By figuring out the "reference tree" of papers in your domain, you can better understand the development of the field and pinpoint potential research gaps.

## ⭐ Planned features
- **Paper Management**: Manage your papers and their metadata in the database.
- **Paper Connection**: Visualize the reference network of papers.
- **Note**: Add your thoughts to the papers.

## 🔧 Components
- **Backend** `PaperLinkBackend/`: Java / Spring based backend and database.
- **Visualizer POC** `paperlink-visualizer-poc`: React / Typescript / D3.js PoC for user system and visualizing connections.
